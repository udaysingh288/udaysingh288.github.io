## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** with hands-on experience building **production-grade ML systems**—from forecasting and experimentation pipelines to real-time model serving and LLM-powered applications.

I focus on:
- Turning models into **reliable, scalable systems**
- Strong **MLOps foundations** (versioning, monitoring, automation)
- Clean, reproducible pipelines that teams can trust

Currently working at **WPP Media**, supporting data-driven decisions across large-scale business workflows.

## 🧠 What I Work On

- **Forecasting & Optimization Pipelines**
- **Batch & Real-time ML Systems**
- **Experimentation, Uplift & Causal Modeling**
- **LLM + RAG Applications**
- **MLOps & Model Lifecycle Automation**

## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### 🔹 Production Forecasting & Batch Scoring Pipeline
**Python • BigQuery • Airflow • MLflow • Docker**

- Built end-to-end training and batch scoring pipelines
- Implemented rolling backtests, scheduled retraining, and reproducible configs
- Improved forecast metrics by **10–15%** and reduced manual refresh effort by **30%**

---

### 🔹 Real-time Deep Learning Model Serving
**PyTorch • FastAPI • MLflow • Docker**

- Served a TorchScript PyTorch model via FastAPI with strict Pydantic validation
- Ensured training–inference parity with versioned preprocessing artifacts
- Used MLflow Model Registry for safe, stage-based model loading

---

### 🔹 Experimentation & Uplift Measurement Framework
**FastAPI • LangChain • FAISS/Chroma • OpenAI GPT-4 • Airflow**

- Built a production-style **RAG Q&A API**
- Added caching, rate limiting, and structured JSON outputs
- Implemented regression tests to detect prompt/model drift
- Automated index refresh and backfills via Airflow
